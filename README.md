# JIRA Linker!

This is a GitHub extension that will automatically link back to your private JIRA instance!

## How To Use

1. install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
1. create a new script via the extension once it's installed
1. copy/paste this code to your new script
1. save the script
1. refresh github
1. follow the form in the lower left hand part of the screen

## Pro Tips

If you ever want to edit this form you can click "JIRA Linker Settings" in your profile dropdown menu (at the extreme top right, in github) between "Settings" and "Sign Out".  Also, you can clear localStorage, which will prompt the initial config form to appear again.
